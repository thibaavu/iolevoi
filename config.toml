I think about creativity, knowledge management, learning and traveling like a üê¢.

I am curious by nature, constantly seeking new knowledge. 

I write about optimising education in formal settings and in general. I am fascinated by how we communicate both between humans and across time and space.

I live in regional Victoria on the lands of the Dja Dja Warrung in a straw-bale house that I built and regularly travel in my converted Sprinter van named ‚ÄúVincent Vango‚Äù.
